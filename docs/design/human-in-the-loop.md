# Human-in-the-Loop Configuration Conflict Resolution

## ðŸ§  Feature Concept

**Continuum's mission** is to create a seamless interface between human intent and AI behavior. To do that effectively, we need a way to **reconcile layered configurations** â€” personal preferences, organizational policies, project norms, and even branch-specific overrides â€” *without forcing the user to predefine every possible case.*

Instead of silently overriding or failing, we treat config collisions as an opportunity for **interactive, intelligent decision-making**.

## ðŸ§¬ The Problem

Different configuration layers can have conflicting values:

- Joel prefers `low_comments` in his `~/.continuum/profile.yml`
- Cambrian's `.continuum/org/config.yml` enforces `high_comments`
- The project repo `.continuum/default/config.yml` is neutral
- The branch `.continuum/branches/feature-x/config.yml` suggests `comment_density: medium`

Today, these are resolved by implicit priorities (e.g., org > project > user), but that doesn't allow nuance or *user agency* in special cases.

## ðŸ’¡ The Solution: Prompt-Based Resolution at Merge Time

When a conflict is detected during configuration merge, **Continuum pauses and prompts** the user to resolve it â€” with **context, explanation, and scope of impact.**

This is analogous to:
- Git asking how to resolve merge conflicts
- IDEs prompting how to apply code style settings
- Assistants asking "Do you want me to remember this?"

## âœ¨ UX Goals

- **Respect the user** â€” never override silently if it impacts behavior
- **Offer temporality** â€” not just "yes" or "no," but *how long* and *for whom*
- **Enable collaboration** â€” especially between human developers and AI agents
- **Maintain clarity** â€” auditability of config state

## âœ… Prompt Example (CLI or Claude)

> Conflict detected:  
> Org policy enforces `high_comments`, but your profile prefers `low_comments`.
>
> What would you like to do?
>
> - [x] Accept org setting for **this session**
> - [ ] Accept org setting for **this repo**
> - [ ] Keep my personal preference
> - [ ] Something else (type your intent)

> ðŸ’¡ You can set a default in `~/.continuum/profile.yml` under `conflicts:` to avoid being asked again.

## ðŸ¤– Long-Term Thinking

This paves the way for:
- AI-assisted resolution (`continuum resolve` as a command)
- Prompt-based interaction inside Claude itself
- Claude *learning* your preferences from responses over time
- Config regeneration based on your decisions

This is part of making **configuration part of the conversation** â€” not just a static artifact.

It's how Continuum evolves from "a config loader" to **a trusted mediator between human cognition and AI behavior**.

## Implementation Path

1. Implement configuration layer detection and loading
2. Create a conflict detection mechanism during merge
3. Develop the interactive prompt interface
4. Add resolution persistence options
5. Integrate with AI assistants for suggested resolutions
