//! Boot resume for benchmark rounds — REJOIN, never re-dispatch (plan A5).
//!
//! **The law**: continuity is the default, reset is the exception. A `Working`
//! round survives a reboot on disk (its room, cards, driver, per-card activity
//! rooms and assignees — `bench_round`'s file); the solves a restart killed were
//! journaled `failed` by the boot reaper, which releases the `claim-<card>`
//! in-flight guard. So resuming is not a subsystem: it is the SAME ONE driver
//! decision every other edge uses — [`bench_round::next_unworked_per_round`] →
//! [`work::dispatch_staged_swe_solve`] — fired once after boot, whereupon the
//! card-settled edge (benchmark_grade) chains the rest. Each re-fired solve
//! REJOINS its recorded per-instance activity room and re-enters its preserved
//! workspace mid-stride: resume is recall, not restore.
//!
//! **Placement**: this lives on the BENCHMARK side and is invoked from the
//! benchmark module's init — never the serving daemon, whose boot reap
//! explicitly refuses to re-dispatch (a serving daemon that posts work is the
//! parallel-runner shape, BENCHMARKS-ARE-ADAPTERS-NOT-A-RUNNER.md).
//!
//! **The acceptance test this exists for**: dispatch a round, `continuum reboot
//! --force` mid-solve, hands off — the round rejoins its rooms, solves re-fire
//! (`bench.round.resumed`), cards reach terminal, the round reaches Done, with
//! zero operator commands after the reboot.
