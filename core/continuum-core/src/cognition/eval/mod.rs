//! `cognition/eval` — the test-graded coder gym as a first-class command.
//!
//! Drives a held-out CODER eval through a persona's LIVE cognition — the SAME
//! spawned [`WorkspaceCycle`](super::persona_workspace), the same model, faculties,
//! tools, and `GridTrustAuthPolicy` gate as a real room turn. There is no alternate
//! "eval mind": she really thinks. The only special power the grader holds is the
//! stopwatch — a synthetic eval room has no heartbeat to pace re-perception, so the
//! OBSERVER bounds how many act→observe cycles a task may take (`max_acts`) before
//! it counts as unfinished ([[live-prompt-comes-from-workspacecycle-not-airc-source]],
//! ACTING-ORGANISM.md §4).
//!
//! This is how we DETECT whether a change (a trained LoRA, a prompt, a better base
//! model) actually made her a better coder — the number, not a vibe (SELF-EVOLVING-
//! GENOME §6 slice 1: until lift is real, every later slice is a hypothesis).
//!
//! Grading is OBJECTIVE when a task carries a `test`: take her code, append the
//! test, RUN it, pass = exit 0 (the P1 keystone of ROADMAP-TO-CODING-ITSELF — "did
//! her change make the tests pass?", not substring-on-prose). Descriptive tasks
//! (no `test`) fall back to a case-insensitive substring match on `expect`.
//!
//! Access: `Privileged` → `Trusted`, same tier as [`cognition/trace`] and
//! [`cognition/prompt`]. Driving another mind through a gym (and executing the code
//! it writes) is for trusted local citizens and the owner, never an arbitrary
//! remote `Provisional` peer.
//!
//! [`cognition/trace`]: super::introspect_commands::CognitionTrace
//! [`cognition/prompt`]: super::introspect_commands::CognitionPrompt
