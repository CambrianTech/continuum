# CHATGPT GENOME-ASSEMBLY INSIGHTS

This note captures the biological framing and genome-assembly strategy that emerged during design discussions.

## Four-Phase Evolutionary Cycle
| Phase | Similarity | Strategy | Metaphor | Typical Time |
|------:|------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| 1. Search | — | P2P cosine search | Genetic inheritance search | Minutes |
| 2. Use | ≥ 0.90 | Download & use | Genetic cloning | Minutes |
| 3. Refine | 0.75–0.89 | Academy fine-tuning | Adaptive mutation | Hours |
| 4. Create | < 0.60 | Train new | Novel gene invention | Days+ |

**Outcome**: ~91% time savings vs training entirely from scratch.

## Marketplace Dynamics
- Natural selection via usage + success rates (fitness)
- Specialization explosion; poor layers go extinct; great layers spread
- Standing on giants’ shoulders: reuse first, then refine

## Recombination (Crossover) & Innovation
- Single-point, uniform, and capability-aware crossover supported
- Horizontal gene transfer (grafting a capability from another lineage)
- Gene duplication → specialize duplicates

## Example: Biomechanical Engineer Persona
- Download physics/biology/mechanical layers (≥0.87)
- Refine biomechanics layer (0.72 → 0.95 via Academy)
- Train new biomechanical-design capability (not found on mesh)

## Safety & Governance Notes
- License filters and org-only meshes protect IP
- Quarantine new layers until verified; retain lineage & training metadata
