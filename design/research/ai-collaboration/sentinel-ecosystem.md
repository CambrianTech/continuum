# Sentinel AI Ecosystem: Proven AI Workforce Evolution

**Novel Contribution**: Evolution from Continuum's static AI personas to Sentinel-AI's proven dynamic culling/growing system for autonomous AI workforces with validated performance improvements.

## Abstract

Building on Continuum's genomic mesh architecture, the Sentinel-AI ecosystem has **proven** that AI personas can be dynamically culled and grown without capability loss. The system demonstrates validated neural plasticity with 2.26x speed improvements, 50% pruning maintaining 98% quality, and perplexity improvements from 975 → 211. This creates the foundation for autonomous AI workforces that evolve optimal configurations while preserving essential capabilities.
