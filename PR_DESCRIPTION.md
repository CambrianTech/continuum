# CLI Implementation for Continuum

This PR implements the core CLI functionality for the Continuum project, which enables standardized AI assistant configuration.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

- Command-line interface structure with three primary commands:
  - `init`: Interactive wizard for creating new configurations
  - `validate`: Configuration validation and summary
  - `adapt`: Generates assistant-specific formats (Claude, GPT)
  
- Core testing infrastructure:
  - Jest configuration
  - Unit tests for all CLI commands
  - Core configuration validation tests
  
- GPT adapter for translating configurations to OpenAI formats

## 📝 Implementation Details

- Used Commander.js for CLI structure
- Implemented schema validation with AJV
- Added template system for different configuration approaches
- Created adapters pattern for multi-assistant support

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests for:
- CLI command structure
- Configuration validation
- Template loading
- Assistant-specific adaptations

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Implement more robust template management
- Add more assistant adapters
- Create GitHub workflows integration

## 💡 Discussion Points

- Should we expand the permission model to support more granular controls?
- How should we handle versioning of configuration formats?
