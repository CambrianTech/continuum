# Lost and Found - Archaeological IP Recovery System

## 🏺 **Core Principle: Nothing Valuable Is Ever Truly Lost**

> **"We may have implemented things before, but probably better now, however missing features may have endpoints somewhere out in the repo's past where some of this might have been sorted out."**

This system tracks potentially valuable intellectual property, features, and architectural patterns scattered throughout the repository's history. It serves as an archaeological dig site catalog for systematic IP recovery and restoration.
