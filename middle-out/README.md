## 🧠 Cognitive Infrastructure Philosophy

### **"Documentation lives where you need it, when you need it"**

This documentation structure follows the **bootloader pattern**:
- **Immediate context** in CLAUDE.md for session progress
- **Eternal principles** in middle-out/ for architectural understanding
- **Specific implementation** in module files for detailed work

### **Autonomous AI Readiness**

Each section is designed for:
- **30-second context recovery** - Quick understanding of current state
- **Technical competence restoration** - Essential tools and patterns
- **Strategic direction clarity** - Philosophy and vision preservation

## 🎯 How to Use This Documentation

### **For New AI Agents**
1. **Quick Start**: Run `npm start` - everything launches automatically
2. Review [Testing Workflow](development/testing-workflow.md) for development methodology
3. Use [JTAG](jtag/README.md) for debugging capabilities
4. Explore architecture sections relevant to your task

### **For Human Developers**
1. Begin with [Getting Started](getting-started/) for mental model
2. Reference [Development](development/) for practical methodologies
3. Dive into [Architecture](architecture/) for system understanding

### **For System Maintenance**
1. Use [JTAG](jtag/) for debugging and monitoring
2. Follow [Development](development/) for systematic changes
3. Apply [Architecture](architecture/) principles for major modifications

## 🌟 Key Principles

### **Middle-Out Methodology**
- **Layer-by-layer validation** - Each layer must be solid before advancing
- **Pattern-based fixes** - Systematic error resolution over individual fixes
- **Self-documenting systems** - Code and architecture that explains itself

### **Autonomous Development**
- **Complete system visibility** - JTAG debugging provides full observability
- **Self-healing capabilities** - Automatic error recovery and resolution
- **Modular architecture** - Independent, discoverable components

### **Cognitive Efficiency**
- **Predictable structure** - Consistent patterns reduce mental overhead
- **Self-contained modules** - Each component includes everything needed
- **Incremental validation** - Continuous verification of progress
