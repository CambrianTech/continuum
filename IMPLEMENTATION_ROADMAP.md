# Continuum Implementation Roadmap
## Precision Tracking for Community Spread Readiness

**Current Status**: `leyline-awakened` - Vision established, implementation in progress

---

## 🎯 **STAY ON TASK PRIORITIES**

### **IMMEDIATE FOCUS** (Before any community spread)
1. **Fix CommandProcessor routing** - commands must work reliably
2. **Establish TypeScript runtime** - daemons must execute properly  
3. **Validate core workflows** - migration, screenshot, help commands working
4. **Test stability** - no crashes, proper error handling, graceful fallbacks

### **NO DISTRACTIONS**
- ❌ Marketing or keyword optimization
- ❌ Feature expansion beyond core functionality
- ❌ Documentation beyond implementation needs
- ❌ Community outreach until alpha readiness

---

## 📊 **AUTONOMY PROGRESSION TRACKING**

### **Current Claude Autonomy: ~30%**
| Capability | Status | Blocker |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Code Understanding | ✅ 90% | None |
| Architecture Design | ✅ 85% | None |
| TypeScript Execution | ❌ 0% | No runtime compilation |
| Real-time Testing | ❌ 10% | Limited browser integration |
| Independent Problem Solving | 🔄 60% | Needs execution capability |

### **Alpha Target: ~70% Autonomy**
| Capability | Target | Requirements |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Code Execution | 80% | TypeScript runtime or compilation |
| Browser Testing | 70% | DevTools integration working |
| Daemon Management | 75% | Process spawning and monitoring |
| Community Coordination | 60% | Multi-AI chat orchestration |
