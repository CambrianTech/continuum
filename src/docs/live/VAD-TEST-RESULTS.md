## Test Results

### RMS VAD Performance

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | 2/7 = **28.6%** |
| **Latency** | 5μs per frame |
| **Real-time factor** | 6400x |
| **False positive rate** | 71.4% (5/7 samples) |

### Detailed Accuracy Breakdown

```
📊 RMS VAD Accuracy Test (512 samples = 32ms @ 16kHz):

  ✓ Silence              → is_speech=false (CORRECT)
  ✗ White Noise          → is_speech=true  (WRONG)
  ✓ Clean Speech         → is_speech=true  (CORRECT)
  ✗ Factory Floor        → is_speech=true  (WRONG)
  ✗ TV Dialogue          → is_speech=true  (WRONG)
  ✗ Music                → is_speech=true  (WRONG)
  ✗ Crowd Noise          → is_speech=true  (WRONG)

📈 RMS VAD Accuracy: 2/7 = 28.6%
```

### Factory Floor Scenario (User's Use Case)

**Continuous background noise test**:

```
🏭 Factory Floor Scenario:

   Frame  0: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  1: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  2: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  3: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  4: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  5: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  6: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  7: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  8: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)
   Frame  9: is_speech=true (FALSE POSITIVE)

Result: 10/10 frames = false positives
⚠️  RMS triggers on ALL machinery noise
```

### Threshold Sensitivity Analysis

**Problem**: RMS cannot be "tuned" to fix the issue

```
🔧 RMS Threshold Sensitivity (TV Dialogue Test):

   Threshold  100: is_speech=true
   Threshold  300: is_speech=true
   Threshold  500: is_speech=true (current default)
   Threshold 1000: is_speech=true (2x default)
   Threshold 2000: is_speech=true (4x default)
```

**Conclusion**: Even at 4x threshold, RMS still treats TV as speech.
**Reason**: TV and speech have similar RMS energy levels.

## Why RMS Fails

### Energy vs Pattern Recognition

| Audio Type | RMS Energy | RMS Detects | Should Detect |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Silence | 0 | ✓ No | ✓ No |
| White Noise | 1000-2000 | ✗ Yes | ✓ No |
| Speech | 1000-5000 | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |
| Factory Floor | 1500-3000 | ✗ Yes | ✓ No |
| TV Dialogue | 2000-4000 | ✗ Yes | ✓ No |
| Music | 2000-5000 | ✗ Yes | ✓ No |
| Crowd Noise | 1500-3000 | ✗ Yes | ✓ No |

**RMS only measures VOLUME, not speech patterns.**

### What Silero Does Differently

Silero VAD uses ML to recognize **speech patterns**:

- Formant frequencies (vowel resonances)
- Pitch contours (intonation)
- Spectral envelope (voice timbre)
- Temporal dynamics (rhythm of speech)

**It's trained on 6000+ hours of real speech with background noise.**

## Synthesized Audio Quality

### Background Noise Simulations

1. **Factory Floor**
   - 60Hz electrical hum (base frequency)
   - Random clanks every ~500 samples
   - RMS: 1500-3000

2. **TV Dialogue**
   - Mix: Male voice (150Hz) + Female voice (250Hz) + Background music (440Hz)
   - Simulates overlapping dialogue with soundtrack
   - RMS: 2000-4000

3. **Music**
   - C major chord: C (261Hz), E (329Hz), G (392Hz)
   - Constant harmonic structure
   - RMS: 2000-5000

4. **Crowd Noise**
   - 5 overlapping random voices (150-300Hz)
   - Simulates many people talking
   - RMS: 1500-3000

5. **Clean Speech**
   - 200Hz fundamental (male voice)
   - 400Hz 2nd harmonic (realistic timbre)
   - RMS: 1000-5000

### Limitations of Sine Wave Simulation

**Note**: These are crude simulations. Real audio is more complex:

- Real speech: Dynamic formants, pitch variations, consonants
- Real TV: Dialogue + music + sound effects + compression artifacts
- Real factory: Variable machinery, echoes, transient impacts

**Expected**: Silero accuracy would be HIGHER with real audio (trained on real data).

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Download Silero Model (Recommended)

```bash
mkdir -p models/vad
curl -L https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/raw/master/files/silero_vad.onnx \
  -o models/vad/silero_vad.onnx
```

### Phase 2: Test Silero Accuracy

```bash
# Run Silero accuracy test
cargo test --package streaming-core test_silero_accuracy_rate -- --ignored --nocapture

# Expected result: >85% accuracy (vs 28.6% for RMS)
```

### Phase 3: Deploy and Test

```bash
# Deploy with Silero VAD
npm start

# Test with TV background noise
# Should only transcribe YOUR speech, not TV audio
```

### Phase 4: Production Tuning (Optional)

```bash
# Adjust Silero threshold if needed (default: 0.5)
export SILERO_THRESHOLD=0.6  # More conservative (fewer false positives)
# OR
export SILERO_THRESHOLD=0.4  # More sensitive (catch quiet speech)
```
