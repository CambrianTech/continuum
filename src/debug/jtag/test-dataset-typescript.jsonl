{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Explain interfaces in TypeScript"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Interfaces define the structure of objects in TypeScript. They specify what properties and methods an object should have, providing type safety and code completion."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What are generics?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Generics allow you to create reusable components that work with multiple types instead of a single one. They provide type safety while maintaining flexibility."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"How do I use async/await?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Async/await is syntactic sugar for promises. Mark a function as 'async', then use 'await' to pause execution until a promise resolves. This makes asynchronous code look synchronous and easier to read."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What's the difference between interface and type?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Both define object shapes, but interfaces can be extended and merged while types are more flexible with unions and intersections. For object shapes, prefer interfaces. For complex types, use type aliases."}]}
