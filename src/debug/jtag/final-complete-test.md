FINAL Complete Bulletproof Validation Test

Testing the complete bulletproof precommit validation system with:
- TypeScript compilation
- System deployment
- CRUD integration tests (must be 100%)
- Screenshot proof collection
- Complete session artifacts collection
- Validation summary appended to commit message
- Automatic commit failure if tests fail

This is the final test to get complete validation with session artifacts included in the commit itself.
