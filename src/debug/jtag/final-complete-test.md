# Final Complete Validation Test 1758947912

Step 2 Testing: Commit Message Enhancement Validation (Test #4 - Debug)

Testing that our precommit hook properly appends validation summaries to commit messages.

Using prepare-commit-msg hook approach with simplified precommit validation to properly enhance commit messages with validation results.

Added debug logging to both hooks to diagnose why validation summaries aren't appearing.

This is the final test to get complete validation with session artifacts included in the commit itself.
