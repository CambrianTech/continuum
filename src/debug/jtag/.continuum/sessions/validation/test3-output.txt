💡 Debugging tips:
   1. Check UserDaemon created PersonaUsers: grep "UserDaemon: Registered" .continuum/jtag/system/logs/npm-start.log
   2. Check event subscriptions: grep "Subscribing to chat events" .continuum/jtag/system/logs/npm-start.log
   3. Check ThoughtStream: grep "ThoughtStream" .continuum/jtag/sessions/system/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/logs/ai-decisions.log
   4. Check for errors: grep "ERROR" .continuum/jtag/system/logs/npm-start.log
