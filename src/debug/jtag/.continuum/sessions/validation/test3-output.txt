✅ JTAGClient: Completed correlation client_1761540222559_k1t4ivt7
✅ Test message sent: "AI Response Test: 1761540222553"

📋 Step 4: Verifying AI system processed message...
✅ AI system is active (log contains entries)

🎉 AI Response Integration Test: PASSED
=====================================
✅ Message sent via chat widget
✅ AI decision log exists and is active
✅ Event system working

Note: Actual AI responses may take 30-60s to appear in log.
This test verifies the SYSTEM works, not response speed.
