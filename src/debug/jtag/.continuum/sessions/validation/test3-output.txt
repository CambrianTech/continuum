Request timeout after 30000ms

💡 Debugging tips:
   1. Check DecisionEntity table: ./jtag data/list --collection=decisions --limit=5
   2. Run report manually: ./jtag ai/report/decisions --limit=5 --verbose=true
   3. Check AI decisions log: .continuum/jtag/sessions/system/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/logs/ai-decisions.log
   4. Check for errors: grep "ERROR" .continuum/jtag/system/logs/npm-start.log
