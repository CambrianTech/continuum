## 🗄️ **ARCHIVED DOCUMENTS** (Historical/Superseded)

### **Legacy Roadmaps**: 
- `ROADMAP.md` - **SUPERSEDED** by MASTER_ROADMAP.md
- `INTEGRATION_TESTING_ROADMAP.md` - **INTEGRATED** into MASTER_ROADMAP.md  
- `INTEGRATION_TESTING_ALIGNMENT.md` - **INTEGRATED** into MASTER_ROADMAP.md

### **Completed Work**:
- `INTEGRATION-TEST-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Historical integration planning
- `INTEGRATION-TEST-CHAIN.md` - Early integration concepts
- `ROUTER_TESTING_COMPLETE.md` - Router testing completion record

**Status**: 🗄️ **ARCHIVE** - Keep for historical reference but not active planning

## 🔄 **DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY**

### **Active Documents** (Update regularly)
1. **`MASTER_ROADMAP.md`** - Primary roadmap (update with milestone progress)
2. **`refined_architecture_plan.md`** - Architecture insights (update with discoveries)  
3. **`services/ai/AI_SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - AI design details (update with implementation)

### **Reference Documents** (Keep but don't update)
- Historical roadmaps and planning documents
- Completed analysis and investigation records
- Architectural exploration documents

### **Maintenance Protocol**
- **Weekly**: Update MASTER_ROADMAP.md with milestone progress
- **Monthly**: Review and clean up outdated documents  
- **Release**: Archive superseded planning documents
- **Never delete**: Keep all documents for historical context
