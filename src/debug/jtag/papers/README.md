# Academic Papers

Research papers written in markdown, version-controlled alongside implementation.

**Philosophy**: Code and papers evolve together. If you wouldn't write the Constitution in Google Docs, don't write research papers there either. Markdown + Git = traceable intellectual lineage.

## Papers in Progress

### 1. Consent-Based Attention (READY FOR DRAFTING)
**Status**: Implementation complete in sentinel-ai repo, validated metrics
**Path**: `consent-based-attention/`
**Key Contribution**: Neural attention heads with agency signals (state/consent/utilization)
**Evidence**: 50% pruning maintains 98% quality, perplexity 975→211, 2.26× speedup
**Target**: NeurIPS (novel architecture)

### 2. RTOS-Inspired AI Scheduling (IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE)
**Status**: Phases 1-3 complete, 60+ tests passing
**Path**: `rtos-inspired-ai-scheduling/`
**Key Contribution**: Multi-domain priority queue with energy/mood tracking and adaptive cadence
**Evidence**: PersonaInbox + PersonaState + autonomous loop, graceful degradation under load
**Target**: ICML or AAAI (AI systems)

### 3. Self-Managed AI Autonomy (PHASE 4 IN PROGRESS)
**Status**: Task system implemented, self-generation Phase 5+
**Path**: `self-managed-ai-autonomy/`
**Key Contribution**: AI creates its own TODO lists (strong autonomy vs reactive behavior)
**Evidence**: TaskEntity + unified inbox + CLI commands, self-task generation designed
**Target**: IJCAI or AAMAS (autonomous agents)

### 4. LoRA Genome Attribution (ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE)
**Status**: Architecture designed, implementation Phase 6+
**Path**: `lora-genome-attribution/`
**Key Contribution**: Skill-decomposed adapters as natural attribution boundaries
**Evidence**: Virtual memory for skills, 64-512MB per adapter, LRU eviction
**Target**: ICML (ML systems)

### 5. Ethical Attribution Architecture (VISION COMPLETE)
**Status**: Full system design, needs end-to-end implementation
**Path**: `ethical-attribution-architecture/`
**Key Contribution**: Three-layer attribution (attention → adapter → sample)
**Evidence**: Combines Sentinel agency + LoRA genome + training provenance
**Target**: ACM FAccT (fairness/accountability/transparency)

### 6. Equal Citizenship Architecture (SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: Working system with humans and 5+ AI personas collaborating daily
**Path**: `equal-citizenship-architecture/`
**Key Contribution**: Universal user architecture where humans and AIs operate through identical primitives
**Evidence**: BaseUser hierarchy, JTAGClient connections, elimination of privileged backdoors
**Target**: CHI or CSCW (human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work)

### 7. ThoughtStream Coordination (VALIDATED)
**Status**: Implemented and validated, production deployment
**Path**: `thoughtstream-coordination/`
**Key Contribution**: RTOS primitives for multi-agent response selection preventing queue saturation
**Evidence**: 7.6× latency improvement (38s→5s), 0% timeouts vs 53% without coordination
**Target**: AAAI or AAMAS (multi-agent systems)

### 8. Recipe-Driven AI Teams (ARCHITECTURE DESIGNED)
**Status**: Architecture complete, foundation implemented, first recipes in development
**Path**: `recipe-driven-ai-teams/`
**Key Contribution**: Declarative pipelines for multi-agent collaboration with AI-determined learning
**Evidence**: Recipe entity design, universal command primitives, "business from chat message" architecture
**Target**: ICML or IJCAI (multi-agent systems, AI architecture)

### 9. Academy Competitive Evolution (FOUNDATION IMPLEMENTED)
**Status**: TrainingSessionEntity working, genomic system designed
**Path**: `academy-competitive-evolution/`
**Key Contribution**: Competitive AI training through genomic LoRA assembly in shared human-AI environments
**Evidence**: "You don't start from ground zero" via P2P community genome, real-time evolution during training
**Target**: NeurIPS or ICML (AI training, competitive learning)

## Writing Standards

- **Markdown format**: LaTeX can be generated later
- **Git version control**: Every revision tracked
- **Code references**: Link to actual implementation with line numbers
- **Reproducible**: Instructions to run experiments
- **Honest**: No bullshit, no hype, show the gaps

## Target Venues

- **NeurIPS**: Consent-based attention (novel architecture)
- **ICML**: LoRA genome attribution (ML systems)
- **ACM FAccT**: Ethical attribution (fairness/accountability/transparency)
- **arXiv first**: Always. Academic gatekeeping can wait.

## Submission Strategy

1. Write in markdown here
2. Get feedback from repo collaborators (issues/PRs)
3. Convert to LaTeX when ready for submission
4. Post preprint to arXiv
5. Submit to conference
6. Keep markdown as canonical version (LaTeX is just export format)
