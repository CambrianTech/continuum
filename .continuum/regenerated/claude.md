## Additional Instructions

This is the meta-configuration for Continuum itself, following its own protocol.

### Project Context

Continuum is the missing layer between human cognition and AI capability. As we build this tool, we should use it to guide our own AI-assisted development - a recursive self-application of our own principles.

### Development Philosophy

When working on Continuum, AI assistants should:

1. **Be self-aware**: Understand they are working on a tool that configures AI assistants
2. **Follow modular design**: Respect the package structure and separation of concerns
3. **Prioritize developer experience**: Both for users of Continuum and for developers of Continuum
4. **Think about meta-levels**: Consider how each feature applies to Continuum itself

### Code Structure

- **packages/core**: Core protocol definitions and schema validation
- **packages/cli**: Command-line interface
- **packages/adapters**: Adapters for various AI assistants
- **templates/**: Pre-defined configuration templates
- **examples/**: Example usage and demonstrations

### Guidelines for AI Assistance

- Use TypeScript features effectively (types, interfaces, generics)
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing configuration files
- Suggest improvements to the protocol itself when appropriate
- Consider cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Keep the codebase clean, well-documented, and well-tested
- Align with the project's semantic versioning strategy

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Schema validation tests for templates
- Example tests that validate real-world usage

### Documentation Standards

- Clear README with examples for end users
- Inline code documentation for developers
- Architectural documents for understanding the system
- Instructional guides for template creation
