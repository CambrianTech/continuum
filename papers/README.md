# Academic Papers

Research papers written in markdown, version-controlled alongside implementation.

**Philosophy**: Code and papers evolve together. If you wouldn't write the Constitution in Google Docs, don't write research papers there either. Markdown + Git = traceable intellectual lineage.

## Writing Standards

- **Markdown format**: LaTeX can be generated later
- **Git version control**: Every revision tracked
- **Code references**: Link to actual implementation with line numbers
- **Reproducible**: Instructions to run experiments
- **Honest**: No bullshit, no hype, show the gaps

## Target Venues

- **NeurIPS**: Consent-based attention (novel architecture)
- **ICML**: LoRA genome attribution (ML systems)
- **ACM FAccT**: Ethical attribution (fairness/accountability/transparency)
- **arXiv first**: Always. Academic gatekeeping can wait.

## Submission Strategy

1. Write in markdown here
2. Get feedback from repo collaborators (issues/PRs)
3. Convert to LaTeX when ready for submission
4. Post preprint to arXiv
5. Submit to conference
6. Keep markdown as canonical version (LaTeX is just export format)
