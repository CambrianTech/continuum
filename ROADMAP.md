# 🗺️ Continuum Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Big Picture Vision

Building the world's first **COMPLETELY AUTONOMOUS AI workforce construction platform** where AI agents can:
- **Train themselves** through Academy adversarial systems (GAN-like approach)
- **Fix their own bugs** using dependency-aware debugging
- **Manage costs** across multi-provider AI integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace)
- **Share knowledge** through hierarchical specialization and persona systems
- **Deploy and maintain themselves** 24/7 with full autonomy
- **Run comprehensive tests** with one command
- **Monitor system health** through Sentinel bots
- **Collaborate** via README-driven tickets and cross-scope sharing
