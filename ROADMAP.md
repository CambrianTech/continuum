- **v2.0** (2025-06-18): **CRITICAL RESTORATION AUDIT** - Documented lost advanced capabilities
  - Added Phase 0: Critical Restoration (lost AI browser automation, dynamic UI, multi-agent coordination)
  - Reclassified lost features as HIGH PRIORITY BUGS
  - Added evidence of working components vs broken integration
  - Reorganized priorities to focus on restoration before enhancement
  - Added Mass Effect-inspired UI vision and advanced automation goals

## 🎯 Critical Understanding for New Agents

**🔥 BREAKTHROUGH: Found the lost automation system in `trust_the_process.py`!**

**Git commits reveal the sophisticated capabilities that existed:**
- **`40d51da`**: "modular TRUST THE PROCESS automation for fresh agents" (336 lines of automation!)
- **`bfa87d2`**: "auto-open screenshots for User visual verification" 
- **`8e4b4db`**: "elegant modular screenshot utilities with unit tests"
- **`81031c6`**: "JavaScript execution promise handling for agent autonomy"

**Working Automation Found:**
- ✅ AI agents control browsers via `client.js.execute()` - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- ✅ Screenshot automation with auto-opening - FULLY FUNCTIONAL  
- ✅ Before/after capture and validation - FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- ✅ WebSocket integration and error detection - FULLY FUNCTIONAL

**Still Need to Restore:**
- Mass Effect-style dynamic panels with detailed agent information
- Multi-agent chat coordination with group selection from UI
- Integrated academy management directly from UI (DEPLOY/RETRAIN/SHARE buttons)
- Agent-to-agent task delegation and automation

**The Gap:** The automation foundation exists but isn't connected to the beautiful UI components!

The screenshots prove the beautiful UI exists. The academy system works. The command line tools function. But the **automation integration that made AI agents autonomous** is broken.

**Mission**: Restore the lost AI automation capabilities that made this system revolutionary.

## 🔍 CRITICAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL FINDINGS (2025-06-18)

- DEPLOY/RETRAIN/SHARE buttons not wired to `trust_the_process.py` automation
- Mass Effect slideout panels deleted (but recoverable)
- Multi-agent selection interface deleted (but recoverable)
- WebSocket message routing may have gaps

### 🎯 PRIORITY 1 RESTORATION PLAN

2. **Test multi-agent selection**: Verify group chat functionality restored
3. **Validate Academy pipeline**: Ensure training completion updates UI
4. **Screenshot automation**: Connect slideout interactions to before/after capture

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 days)**
1. **Agent-to-agent spawning**: AI agents creating and managing other agents
2. **Dynamic threshold adjustment**: Academy graduation requirements from UI
3. **Real-time training visualization**: Watch TestingDroid vs ProtocolSheriff battles
4. **Autonomous deployment**: Graduated personas auto-deploy to production

### 📊 ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE PRESERVED

**Documentation Strategy Working**:
- **FILES.md**: Complete archaeological record with visual documentation preserved
- **Generator script**: Successfully preserves agent-written content while updating tree
- **Tombstone system**: Minimized view with full restoration strategies
- **Screenshot analysis**: Detailed widget breakdowns for future agents

**Git History Mapped**:
- **Automation foundation**: Commits `40d51da`, `bfa87d2`, `8e4b4db` contain working browser control
- **UI deletion event**: Commit `41c02a2` "test cleanup" deleted Mass Effect components
- **Recovery strategy**: Exact git commands documented for component restoration

**Mission**: Restore the lost AI automation capabilities that made this system revolutionary.

**The Breakthrough**: We found the automation system wasn't broken - it was just disconnected from the UI during cleanup. The sophisticated capabilities exist and are recoverable!
